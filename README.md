# ðŸ’³ PaymentProcessor

This project focusing on **Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Exceptions**. It implements a **Payment Processing System** that supports various payment types and operations.

## ðŸ“œ **Project Overview**
This system manages different types of payments and performs operations such as:
- Adding and retrieving payments
- Processing payments based on validation rules
- Comparing risks between payments
- Increasing transaction amounts
- Writing payment details to a file

## âš¡ **Features**
âœ… Supports multiple payment types: **Credit, Debit, Mobile, Digital Wallet**  
âœ… Implements **polymorphism** for handling different payment processing rules  
âœ… Compares transaction **risks** based on custom calculations  
âœ… Implements **file handling** to save payment records  
âœ… **Unit tests** included to verify correctness  

## ðŸ”§ **How to Compile & Run**
To compile all Java files:
```sh
javac *.java


ðŸš€ Contributing

// Create a PaymentProcessor
PaymentProcessor proc = new PaymentProcessor();

// Add payments
proc.addToPaymentList(new CreditPayment("Groceries", 42.5, "9/9",
                "4444 5555 6666 7777", 12, 2025, 1200, 100));

// Apply an increase of 1.5x
proc.applyIncrease(1.5);

// Compare risks
int result = PaymentProcessor.compareRisk(payment1, payment2);
System.out.println("Risk Comparison: " + result);
